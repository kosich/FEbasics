                <h3>Creation</h3>
                <p> Nature, first created in 1869, was not the first magazine of its kind in Britain. One journal to precede
                    Nature was Recreative Science: A Record and Remembrancer of Intellectual Observation, which, created
                    in 1859, began as a natural history magazine and progressed to include more physical observational science
                    and technical subjects and less natural history.[12] The journal's name changed from its original title
                    to Intellectual Observer: A Review of Natural History, Microscopic Research, and Recreative Science and
                    then later to the Student and Intellectual Observer of Science, Literature, and Art.[13] While Recreative
                    Science had attempted to include more physical sciences such as astronomy and archaeology, the Intellectual
                    Observer broadened itself further to include literature and art as well.[13] Similar to Recreative Science
                    was the scientific journal Popular Science Review, created in 1862,[14] which covered different fields
                    of science by creating subsections titled <a href="#" class="highlighted">Scientific Summary"</a> or "Quarterly Retrospect", with book reviews
                    and commentary on the latest scientific works and publications.[14] Two other journals produced in England
                    prior to the development of Nature were the Quarterly Journal of Science and Scientific Opinion, established
                    in 1864 and 1868, respectively.[13] The journal most closely related to Nature in its editorship and
                    format was The Reader, created in 1864; the publication mixed science with literature and art in an attempt
                    to reach an audience outside of the scientific community, similar to Popular Science Review.</p>

                <h3>Norman Lockye</h3>
                <p>
                    Norman Lockyer, the founder of Nature, was a professor at Imperial College. He was succeeded as editor in 1919 by Sir Richard
                    Gregory.[19] Gregory helped to establish Nature in the international scientific community. His obituary
                    by the Royal Society stated: "Gregory was always very interested in the international contacts of science,
                    and in the columns of Nature he always gave generous space to accounts of the activities of the International
                    Scientific Unions."[20] During the years 1945 to 1973, editorship of Nature changed three times, first
                    in 1945 to A. J. V. Gale and L. J. F. Brimble (who in 1958 became the sole editor), then to John Maddox
                    in 1965, and finally to David Davies in 1973.[19] In 1980, Maddox returned as editor and retained his
                    position until 1995. Philip Campbell has since become Editor-in-chief of all Nature publications.[19]
