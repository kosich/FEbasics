            <h1>BMW</h1>
            <p> Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (German pronunciation: [ˈbaɪ̯ʁɪʃə mɔˈtʰɔʁn̩ ˈvɛɐ̯kə] (About this sound listen); German
                for Bavarian Motor Works), usually known under its abbreviation BMW (German pronunciation: [ˈbeːˈʔɛmˈveː]
                (About this sound listen)), is a German luxury vehicle, motorcycle, and engine manufacturing company founded
                in 1916. It is one of the best-selling luxury automakers in the world.[3] The company is a component of the
                Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[4] Headquartered in Munich, Bavaria, BMW is the parent company of Mini
                and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. The company produces motorcars under the BMW Motorsport division and motorcycles
                under BMW Motorrad, and plug-in electric cars under the BMW i sub-brand and the "iPerformance" model designation
                within the regular BMW lineup.</p>
            <p> BMW was established as a business entity following a restructuring of the Rapp Motorenwerke aircraft manufacturing
                firm in 1912 named Aerowerke Gustav Otto. After the end of World War I in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine
                production by the terms of the Versailles Armistice Treaty.[5] The company consequently shifted to motorcycle
                production as the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted in 1923,[6] followed by automobiles in
                1928–29.[7][8][9]</p>

            <p>The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production
                was the Dixi, based on the Austin 7 and licensed from the Austin Motor Company in Birmingham, England.</p>

            <p>BMW's first significant aircraft engine, and commercial product of any sort, was the BMW IIIa inline-six liquid-cooled
                engine of 1918, known for good fuel economy and high-altitude performance.[10] With German rearmament in
                the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the Luftwaffe. The factory in Munich made
                ample use of forced labour: foreign civilians, prisoners of war and inmates of the concentration camp Dachau
                [1]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the BMW 132 and BMW 801 air-cooled radial engines,
                and the pioneering BMW 003 axial-flow turbojet, which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered "emergency
                fighter", the Heinkel He 162 Spatz. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime power plant in the
                first prototype of the Messerschmitt Me 262, the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed
                on takeoff with only the standby Junkers Jumo 210 nose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.[11][12]
                The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official
                top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph). The first-ever four-engine jet aircraft ever flown were the sixth and eighth
                prototypes of the Arado Ar 234 jet reconnaissance-bomber, which used BMW 003 jets for power. Through 1944
                the 003's reliability improved, making it a suitable power plant for air frame designs competing for the
                Jägernotprogramm's light fighter production contract. which was won by the Heinkel He 162 Spatz design. The
                BMW 003 aviation turbojet was also under consideration as the basic starting point for a pioneering turboshaft
                powerplant for German armored fighting vehicles in 1944–45, as the GT 101.[13] Towards the end of the Third
                Reich, BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the Luftwaffe, the BMW Strahlbomber, the BMW Schnellbomber
                and the BMW Strahljäger, but none of them were built.[14][15]</p>


            <p>By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was
                held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find an alternative. It was decided to carry on by trying
                to cash in on the current economy car boom exploited so successfully by German ex-aircraft manufacturers
                such as Messerschmitt and Heinkel. BMW bought the rights to manufacture the Italian Iso Isetta. BMW's version
                of the tiny cars were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful
                and helped the company get back on its feet.</p>

            <p>Since 1959, the controlling majority shareholder of the BMW Aktiengesellschaft has been the Quandt family, which
                owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in public float.</p>

            <p>BMW acquired the Hans Glas company based in Dingolfing, Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as
                BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to
                Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,[16] although some
                saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate
                gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.[17] The Glas
                factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW
                front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.[18]</p>
