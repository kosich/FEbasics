                <span class="floating">A</span> book is a set of sheets of paper, parchment, or similar materials that are fastened together to hinge at one side. A single
                sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. Writing or images can be printed or drawn
                on a book's pages. An electronic image that is formatted to resemble a book on a computer screen, smartphone
                or e-reader device is known as an electronic book or e-book. The term "books" may also refer to a body of
                works of literature, or a main division of literature (e.g., children's literature) . In
