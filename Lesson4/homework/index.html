        <p> James Evans enjoyed his job as head of human resources at a UK property company. But when that company was taken
          over in 2015, things changed.</p>
        <p>

          Mr Evans (not his real name) says his new managers gave his private office to a colleague, removed his company car and excluded
          him from meetings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The 41-year-old, who eventually signed a confidentiality agreement with a pay-off to leave the company, believes his new
          managers did this to free his role for one of their own top executives. Because of the agreement, he does not want
          to give his real name.

        </p>
        <p>
          “The aim was to make me feel so undervalued and humiliated” that he would go of his own accord, he says. “It was hard to
          take.”

        </p>
        <p>Mr Evans was likely to have been “managed out”, a process that companies sometimes turn to as an alternative to redundancy
          programmes and as a way of selecting those employees they would like to lose. In the UK and the US, where the process
          is sometimes known as “counselling out”, it involves persuading an employee that it would be in their interests
          to leave, often with a reasonable financial settlement thrown in.</p>
        <p>

          Employment law varies from country to country, but in England, for example, employees have a legal right not to be dismissed
          unfairly. Yet there are ways for employers to get rid of staff and stay within the law.
