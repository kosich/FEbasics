    Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkᵻˈpiːdiə/ (About this sound listen) or /ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə/ (About this sound listen) WIK-i-PEE-dee-ə) is a free
    online encyclopedia with the aim to allow anyone to edit articles.[3] Wikipedia is the largest and most popular general
    reference work on the Internet[4][5][6] and is ranked among the ten most popular websites.[7] Wikipedia is owned by the
    nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation.[8][9][10] Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[11]
    Sanger coined its name,[12][13] a portmanteau of wiki[notes 4] and encyclopedia. There was only the English-language
    version initially, but it quickly developed similar versions in other languages, which differ in content and in editing
    practices. With 5,447,523 articles,[notes 5] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias.
    Overall, Wikipedia consists of more than 40 million articles in more than 250 different languages[15] and, as of February
    2014, it had 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors each month.[16] As of March 2017, Wikipedia
    has about forty thousand high-quality articles known as Featured Articles and Good Articles that cover vital topics.[17][18]
    In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 science articles from Encyclopædia Britannica and Wikipedia, and
    found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Encyclopædia Britannica.[19] Wikipedia has been criticized
    for allegedly exhibiting systemic bias, presenting a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",[20] and,
    in controversial topics, being subject to manipulation and spin.[21Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkᵻˈpiːdiə/ (About this sound listen)
